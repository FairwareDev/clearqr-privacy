# Privacy Policy for ClearQR

**Effective Date:** July 27, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how "Fairware" (the "Developer") handles information in the ClearQR mobile application (the "App").

Our commitment to your privacy is at the core of our brand. We believe in ethical, transparent software.

### Information We Do Not Collect

ClearQR is designed from the ground up to respect your privacy. We **do not** collect, store, or transmit any personal information or usage data. Specifically:

*   We do not collect your name, email address, or other contact information.
*   We do not use any analytics or tracking services.
*   We do not monitor your usage of the app.
*   We do not have a server that stores your data. All your data remains on your device.

### Information Stored Locally on Your Device

To provide its features, ClearQR stores a small amount of data directly and only on your device:

*   **Scan & Creation History:** If you choose to enable the "Save to history" feature, the content of the QR codes you scan or create is saved in a local database on your device. This data is for your use only and is never transmitted to us or any third party. You can clear this history at any time from the app's settings.
*   **App Settings:** Your preferences, such as your chosen theme (light/dark) and other settings, are saved locally on your device so the app can remember your choices.

### Permissions Requested

ClearQR requests the following permissions only to enable its core features. We do not use these permissions to collect any personal data.

*   **Camera:** Required to scan QR codes using your device's camera.
*   **Photo Library / Storage:** Required to save QR codes you generate to your device's gallery.
*   **Contacts (Read & Write):** Required to save contact information to your device's address book when you scan a vCard QR code.
*   **Wi-Fi State & Location:** Modern Android versions require both Wi-Fi and Location permissions to scan for and connect to Wi-Fi networks from a QR code. Your location data is used only for this purpose and is never stored or transmitted.
*   **Biometrics:** Required to enable the optional "Lock app" feature using your device's fingerprint or face sensor.

### In-App Purchases

ClearQR is a free download and offers premium features via a **one-time purchase**. We use Google Play's billing service to handle this transaction. All payment information is securely managed by Google. We do not receive or store any of your payment details, such as credit card numbers. We only receive a confirmation from Google when a purchase is successful. This purchase is non-consumable and can be restored on any device using the same Google account. For more information, please refer to Google's Privacy Policy.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App.
